                            <p> Bit of a tricky sounding one i know, but i've crashed upon: \ picking up the Gabe's Bark audio and after a couple of lines of dialogue from Mobius \ retrieving the first quest item in the stealth suit basic initialization test amp#x200B; Don't know how related this is but a short while back I was having crashes after successfully hacking terminals, a certain line of dialogue from Yes Man after telling him everything was ready for the final mission, and applying weapon mods. These stopped. Hey guys.im having trouble with skyrim where i constantly crash while running around outside skyrim.and i cant pinpoint the mod thats causing it.took me about two days to install everything and then i run into this problem. amp#x200B; My pc specs are i5 2400 gts 1060 3gb 8gb ram.I get round 60fps with all the graphical mods i had. amp#x200B; Heres my load order.thanks!! amp#x200B; some mods i had to move under requiem.and i used loot adn tes5edit to clean the dirty. # Introduction This is version 2.0 of the guide that I posted in September of 2018. In the six months since then I have continuously edited, revised and added to the guide. I feel that it is improved and different enough to merit a repost. I will provide a link to the original at the bottom of this post, though since I made the changes directly to the original by editing it, the two posts will not look much different. This guide is an attempt to create a catalog of all the unofficial rules. amp#x200B; # What you need: A computer with adb on it (do a google search to find out how to get adb) A good working SD card Some patience # IMPORTANT: Everything will be removed from your phone!!!!!!!!!!! Make a backup if you want to keep your files. # !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!YOU DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! # Bugs/Not working: VoLTE # Download the following files to the mentioned device/folder: \- Download TWRP\_Treble.img on your computer : https://yadi.sk/d/OmCp50PQBI. So I was trying to uninstall the two episodes of Gates to Asgaard that I had installed in my game, and now my game CTD at the first loading screen before the main menu shows up. I tried reinstalling the mods, but it still crashes. Please help! This is my current mod list: 0 0 Oblivion.esm 1 1 SoVvM.esm 2 2 CM Partners.esm 3 3 Artifactsstore.esm 4 4 Artifacts.esm 5 5 Cobl Main.esm 6 6 Children Of Rourken.esm 7 7 Knights. Every time I start a new game, I get this glitch whenever I go over to where the first Geckos you encounter with Sunny and her dog will die in a quick very way. Then after that when before I went over to clear out the Geckos at the second water source, I would keep getting kill exps even though I didn't kill anyone by that Goodsprings settler at the third water source. after that I would get Shunned reputation for no reason and Sunny will attack me. Load Order: 0 0 FalloutNV.esm. The game was working fine up until I downloaded and installed some more mods. Every time I start up a new game and leave the Doc's house, walking up the Goodsprings Saloon, my game would act very strange. I can't talk to Easy Pete, pressing the Esc won't open the menu, red icons would appear, some sounds won't play properly, and some invisible NPCs. I have the GOG version of FNV with NVSE NVAC NVSR. I tried turning on Archiveinvalidation Invalidated off and on but that dosen't seem to work. 
I tried using this tool to fix some tears with Fort Akatosh and when it gets to "Tamriel.esp", I get "Unknown Exception occurred, that's not good gt.gt" I'm posting my modlist below: 0 0 Oblivion.esm 1 1 SoVvM.esm 2 2 DibellasWatch.esm 3 3 GTAesgaard_2.esm 4 4 CM Partners.esm 5 5 Artifactsstore.esm 6 6 Artifacts.esm 7 7 Cobl Main.esm 8 8 Children Of Rourken.esm 9 9 Knights. Hello, thank you for your attention. I have been trying for days to get MCM to run properly, but I cannot for the life of me figure out what's wrong. I'm desperate. Please help. amp#x200B; Every time I try to access the MCM, I get this message: The Mod Configuration Menu cannot access its menu files. Either the files are missing, an error has occurred with the NVSE plugin, or a firewall/UAC is preventing access. You may need to reinstall the mod, update your 32-bit Visual C++ 2010 Redistr. Whenever I try to craft anything either from the workbench or a campfire, There would be a small boast to my skill. For example Survival would be at 32 since I tagged that skill at the beginning of the game, but when I go to craft something on the camp it would show it's about 47, same thing happens with the Repair skill. Keep in mind I'm not using any magazines while doing this and I'm not sure if one my mods is doing this Load Order 0 0 FalloutNV.esm 1 1 DeadMoney.esm. edit: I tested out Nova in PvP. He's fucking strong. His 2 just eliminates everyone. iFramed Quicksilver? Dead. Invinc proc Wolverine? Dead. Spiderman iFrames? Dead. Just do 5c, 2c and go take a shit because your job is done. He is squishy outside of his combo, however. His 4 (the iframes) isn't very reliable. Quicksilver seems to have priority when it comes to cancelling iframes. I think Nova would benefit greatly from a defensive obelisk in TL/AC but he's the best character for Universal. Hi im having issues with crashes. I have many mods so I know it has to be a conflict issue. Ive been working on it for about 20 hours in total. Ive made some progress in that i can start the game now. However when loading to the world from the alt start mod, I freeze instantly after loading or shortly after. No error messages or codes. Win10, i78700k, gtx980 0 0 FalloutNV.esm 1 1 DeadMoney.esm 2 2 HonestHearts.esm 3 3 OldWorldBlues.esm 4 4 LonesomeRoad.es. My game was running fine until I changed the interface color as well as the texture size (from large to medium) Here is the load Order: 0 0 FalloutNV.esm 1 1 DeadMoney.esm 2 2 OldWorldBlues.esm 3 3 LonesomeRoad.esm 4 4 HonestHearts.esm 5 5 NVCE Ultimate.esm 6 6 TheSecretBunker.esm 7 7 GunRunnersArsenal.esm 8 8 YUP - Base Game + All DLC.esm 9 9 TribalPack.esm 10 a MercenaryPack.esm 11 b ClassicPack.esm. Title. The little word below the crosshair about what item I'm hovering over won't appear. I for the life of me can't think of the actual term so its hard to troubleshoot. I tried reloading my game but that doesn't change it. Maybe a console command can reload it? I'm sorry if this is a common and easy bug. https://i.imgur.com/WLPljBi.jpg Load order: 0 0 FalloutNV.esm 1 1 DeadMoney.esm 2 2 HonestHearts.esm 3 3 OldWorldBlues.esm 4 4 LonesomeRoad.esm. Hi! I know that New Vegas crashing is something that just happens and can't be helped, however if anyone had a clue of what I may be doing wrong with my set up and how I could fix it, I would greatly appreciate the help, since it's really hard to play if the game crashes on me every hour or so. My system specs are as follows: Windows 10 (build 15063), 64-bit AMD Radeon R9 200 Series Intel Core i3-4160 CPU @ 3.60GHz 8 GB of RAM And my list of mods is as follows: 0 0 FalloutNV.esm 1 1 DeadMo. 
Introduction: Based on the idea of /u/ImCorvec_I_Interject in this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/FutureFight/comments/3o81tz/the_most_difficult_biometrics_to_get) and this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/FutureFight/comments/3olmww/how_hard_are_various_characters_to_farm/), I developed a calculation basis to quantify how hard it is to farm for bios of a specific character. Please note that there are numerous assumptions that have to be made to come up with this ranking. You may disagree. Summary so far: I have Ubuntu 14.04LTS working well on the Surface Book with a patched 3.19.0-31generic kernel. Performance is great, keyboard and trackpad (with multitouch are working as well). You can download the kernel here: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0ByyY7CWbdW6-Z2VkV1FOQWR4TVkampusp=sharing . Currently, the hardware buttons (volume up/power) and touch screen/pen input are not working. More updates to come! ____ Just tried to boot 15.10 from live USB on Surface Introduction: Hi War Thundurrerrrs! It's time to take another peek at the Corsair line in RB air since they were reportedly improved with the v1.61 patch. So let's have a look at the middle of the pack. the F4U-1d! Strategy: As with other US fighters, this is a hit'n'run plane. Advantages are high dive speed at 800+kph and better than average maneuverability at very high speeds. It also accelerates well and retains it's speed much better now that the pylon effect has been removed. I just got a new PC and I tried moving my modded New Vegas game there. I copied the whole game folder, including the Data folder, and also the New Vegas' folder in My Documents/My Games. I pasted these over my fresh Steam download of FNV (though I don't know in what order) and it kind of broke my save game when I loaded it. JIP Companions Command and Control does not work for me anymore though when I started a new game it seemed to be working just fine. I tried reinstalling the game along. Need a little help with the Legendary Modification mod. I know it's really out of date, but it seems to mostly be working right now; the main problem is that I'm not getting effect chips when I try scrapping legendary clothing or items, but I do when I scrap legendary weapons. I've been looking through the files in FO4Edit and while I can usually make a little bit of sense of things (enough to figure out what I want overridden for my merge patch, at least, or to know that one mod changes I am having this VERY strange problem. I started a new game and when I wanted to leave Doc Mitchell's house, I got a crash (Program not responding) on the loading screen. I tried leaving a few more times with the same result. So I uninstalled all mods started a new game again and started adding mods in bundles of 4-6. After about one half of my to-be-modlist was installed I got a crash (Program not responding) when exitting the game. I realized NVSR was not installed, but that didn't solve. </p>
