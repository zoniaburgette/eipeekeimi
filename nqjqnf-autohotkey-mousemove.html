Hey there, I'm getting new hardware soon and I'll finally be able to record in-game video without problems. yay Now I had the idea of making short clips where the camera moves around an emoting champion in the shooting range. Because I'm a perfectionist in these kind of things, I want the camera movement as smooth as possible. One way to do this would be with AutoHotKey's "MouseMove"-Function. It basically moves the mouse automatically in a programmed way. But I'm kinda worried 
welcome everybody I actually- I'm working on a web page (the page is active), and I am now - actually - within it and I want to click a word after searching for it and finding. Is there a hotkey to consume more than one meat per remote use to heal dinos? If not, does anyone know of a mod that will feed a dino as much meat as it needs to heal fully or at least something that feeds a dino more than one meat per click. In AutoHotkey, I want to click my mouse at position X,Y where X and Y are known but then I want it to return to the original position (arbitrary) Right now I just have: f:: Click 987,851 MouseMov. I am looking for software that would allow me to set a specific path and speed of my mouse cursor across the screen (e.g. from the left side of my screen to the right in one second). Any ideas. 
hello, in this video you'll learn how to move your mouse to a specific coordinates with autohotkey. For example you drag a box or input coordinates and it automatically clicks in the area with some space in between.  x, y: Координаты места, куда нужно переместить курсор (могут быть выражениями). Координаты считаются относительно активного окна, если только это не было изменено. Anyone.

We have already a working script that performs what is described in this post in more straightforward way. Scroll down to his comment and upvote. Im still working on the 3 quadrant "manual script". amp#x200B; EDIT:: amp#x200B; Thanks to u/Xeno234 , i have now a clean version of the script.

Die X/Y-Koordinaten der Position, auf die der Mauszeiger bewegt werden. 
I wanted to make a script that lets me move my mouse with the keyboard. Upon doing so I realised that the movement was either too fast or too slow so I split the mouse movement into 2 different layers. with "AltGr + W,A,S,D" I want the mouse to move fast into the 4 directions on the screen. With "AltGr + Alt + W,A,S,D I want the mouse to move slowly into the same directions. When using AltGr with S and D however the mouse always moves slowly as long as the code for the slow movement isn't comme.

It's more of a ridiculous hack that exploits a bug in Skyrim VR through a simple AutoHotKey script. This bug only works under the following conditions: 1. You must be using the SkyUI mod. 2. The Skyrim VR window must have focus (it must be selected / "on top"). 3. The mouse cursor on your desktop must be moving. This is the tricky one. You can test this out yourself by focusing SkyrimVR and moving the mouse around while aiming at menu items. Unfortu. Make sure you keep your version of AHK up to date. Link to AutoHotkey's Command and Syntax Documentation Rules. Be polite and don't insult each other. Download AutoHotkey and use this script to pick Sylas (I made this one for 1600x900 client you might have to edit it to work on yours): #ifwinactive League of Legends \:: mousemove,1040,130 Click Send, Sylas mousemove,480,210 Sleep, 75 Click You click "\" to use it. Then use this script to spam mid or whatever you want just edit it (same as before this is for 1600x900): #ifwinactive League of Legends SetDefaultMouseSpeed, 0 :: mousemove,6. MouseMove. Moves the mouse cursor. MouseMove, X, Y , Speed, R Parameters X, Y. The x/y coordinates to move the mouse to, which can be expressions. Coordinates are relative to the active window unless CoordMode was used to change. This script (PixelNotifier) now sends a notification when the pixel color is present/same as the pixel you picked. Is it possible to reverse it so that the script sends a notification when the color is NOT present/same? `;PixelNotifier.ahk` `; Watches a screen pixel for a specific color, and notifies the user when it occurs.` `;Skrommel @2005` amp#x200B; `#SingleInstance,Force` amp#x200B; `SysGet,workarea,MonitorWorkArea` amp#x200B; `applicationname=PixelNotifier` amp#x200B;. Hi all, Trying to set up a script that performs a series of mousemoves and clicks repeatedly on a loop. ive been using window spy to track. 
So while blowing another 200-something dust on trying to reroll an item, I finally snapped and decided to let my PC do the boring work for me. Step 1: download and install AutoHotKey (https://autohotkey.com) Step 2: put F15:: click, right mouseGetPos, xpos, ypos click, 960, 830, down ; 1080p, 80% UI scale sleep 550 ; it takes 500ms to craft, +50ms margin click, up mousemove, xpos, ypos return into a file called `FIXFUCKINGCRAFTINGFATSHARKRIGHTNOWO. Remarks  ゲームなどでは、あまりに早くマウスカーソルが動くと不都合が発生する場合がある。 Speedを変更することで、時間をかけて移動させることができる。. Hi, I've made a ahk that makes WarCraft 3 use QWER hotkeys. It simply moves the mouse to the command/item slot, presses the mouse and moves the mouse back to where it was. I was a big fan of Blamestars hotkeytool ( https://www.blamestar.de/hotkey\_tool/ (https://www.blamestar.de/hotkey_tool/)) which worked in the same way, but I couldn't get it working with the latest version of WarCraft 3 so I decided to try to make my own using AutoHotkey. To my surprise I actually got it working! Success. 
I'm using mousegetpos to get the current mouse position. I click somewhere else. Then I try to restore the original postion with mousemove. The mouse moves. Kinda. I made an AutoHotkey script that allows you to bind a button ('y' in this example) on your keyboard to clicking "Smooth All" A. Download AutoHotkey (It's not hard or time consuming, especially considering how much time you'll save on smoothing). B. Here is the script I'm using: ampnbsp; #NoEnv SetMouseDelay, -1 SendMode Input y:: MouseGetPos, xpos, ypos MouseMove 2186, 1875 Sleep 100 Click Sleep 100 MouseMove, xpos, ypos return. I will start this discussion by introducing myself, I'm Daubs ingame. Some may know me over the years, but I have never used reddit to spread word or discussion and I probably won't reply much to this thread. I'm a notorious burnout Skiller who founded a skilling clan known as Solace. It's become that time of the year where people are getting bans from AHK and are unclear on if it's legal or not due to Jagex being unclear on a prominent answer until now. Which is you run the risk of getting. MouseMove. Moves the mouse cursor. MouseMove, X, Y , Speed, R Parameters X, Y. The x/y coordinates to move the mouse to, which can be expressions. Coordinates are relative to the active window unless CoordMode was used to change. I haven't had much trouble getting Mid or Zoe in Blind Pick, but I'm lazy, so made a script to automate it. Figure I'd share. Please note it only works with client at 1280x720 resolution. First, you need to download AuthoHotKey (https://autohotkey.com/). Then create a script (Right click on desktop-gtNew-gtAutoHotkeyScript). Then paste this into it: #ifwinactive League of Legends ltENTER KEY HEREgt:: mousemove,40,683 Click Send, Mid Send, {Enter} mousemove. We use cookies for various purposes including analytics.

I've been using it for a while and had no problems. This is a macro I made to make my life easier. I listen to music and podcasts a lot when waiting for a game and I was sick of having to alt tab, pause my content, and alt tab again every time I found a game. I came up with this script to do exactly that automatically when pressing f1 (or any other key of your choosing). This thing works like this: alt tab out, clicks. #NoEnv ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases. Since I can't find any palm rejection (or similar) settings, I decided to turn to AHK instead. After trying a few old (~2010) scripts that did nothing in my case, I broadened my search (looked into batch files, devcon etc.). But I still feel like a simple solution is just around the corner, so I thought I'd ask. The tablet (physical keyboard) has a dedicated button for toggling the touchpad, but AutoHotKey doesn't detect the key. I tried detecting it with this script: #Persistent #Inst. 
X, Y : The x/y coordinates to move the mouse to, which can be expressions. Coordinates are relative to the active window unless CoordMode was used to change. I decided to write an ultimate beginners guide on how to use AutoHotKeys safely. When I wanted to maximize my xp gains by using AHK it took me a full day of reading the documentation, making posts on the AHK forums and scouring this subreddit in search of what was allowed and wouldn't get you banned. So here is a guide that should cover everything you need to know on how to use AHK for all your scaping needs. It's what I would've wanted to come across while first learning Moves the mouse cursor. MouseMove X, Y , Speed, Relative Parameters X, Y. Type: Integer. The x/y coordinates to move the mouse to. Coordinates are relative to the active window unless CoordMode was used to change. Hi all, I ask for those of you more experienced to please look over my code and let me know if I'm making some obvious mistake in my code. DETAILS ABOUT MY ISSUE My AHK script has selectively stopped working ever since I installed Windows 10. In short: Sometimes my hotkeys I've programmed work, and sometimes they don't -- more details below. I have a subroutine that disables my mouse trackpad when I type on the laptop to prevent myself from clicking things as my thumbs hover I have an AHK script that moves a panel from ArtRage, I use blockinput, mousemove before doing the click and drag, so the mouse can't move the cursor while AHK is doing the click I can't say for sure that mousemove was working on my Windows 10 machine before the Fall Creators Update was installed, but I know for certain it is not working now. Steps taken to attempt to fix: -Set autohotkey.exe to run as administrator. This got the rest of the script working, but my mousemove command is not working. -changed the parameters of mousemove. I initially had it as MouseMove,0,0,0,R but I changed it to MouseMove,100,0,20,R to see if I could watch the mouse No third-party component or dll needed, just a slight modification to the mousemove tooltip in the autohotkey manual. The following code is not the whole code or a working program but should demonstrate how to include it in your own Autohotkey 
I think everyone's aware of the kb+m issues with rebinding and ability use. There would be an easy workaround fix for all the issues if you could use Autohotkey: setting hotkeys for preset keys and using MouseMove function to emulate ability input (mouse movement) with your keyboard. Question is: since Absolver is running an anti-cheat software of some kind, is it ok to use it? I'd contact the devs directly myself but it seems like twitter is the only place and they seem to only respond. Wish you had a hotkey for that pesky button above the minimap? Isn't it just the worst when you have a series of units to promote, and for each one you have to move the mouse to the right of the screen then back to the left? I couldn't find anywhere in the code to do this, but there is a way to make your own hotkey. https://autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm autohotkey is free and easy. Download it, then right click on your desktop to make a new script. Right click that script AutoHotkey is a free, open-source custom scripting language for Microsoft Windows, initially aimed at providing easy keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys, fast macro-creation and software automation that allows users of most levels of computer skill to automate repetitive tasks in any Windows application. I have asked this over at the Autohotkey forums, but thought I'd put it here as well. I have a script to automate starting a number of apps, and one part I'd like to do but have no idea how to achieve it. What I want is to start multiple copies of an app (they are VM's and I've got that bit), wait for them to finish loading (I've figured out Winwait, so that's ok) and then move the mouse to the taskbar, over the icon for the first VM, so I can use Aeropeek to watch all the VMs in parallel. 마우스 포인터를 컨트롤 위로 이동하면 발생합니다.Occurs when the mouse pointer is moved over the control. Three days, when I tried to log onto my runescape account I got the "account disabled" message. I don't bot and I never had since I started playing Runescape in 2007, but AHK is the only thing I can think of as to being the reason for the ban. I decided to powermine iron ores at the Al Kharid Mining site since it was the fastest method in F2P Worlds. To be efficient as possible in powermining, I decided to use AutoHotKeys since the laptop I own doesn't have number pads, therefore I couldn't. I am trying to create a script (pls be aware that I am not a programmer) using AutoHotkey that opens a web site, positions the mouse at a specified clickable icon and click repeatedly in a pre-dete.
