Now I know, the feeling of being the one man fighting against the green horde is amazing, but I always loved the set-pieces where there was you, ya bois, and a squad Hi! Wanted to see what everyone thought of my custom chapter, mainly to make sure it was realistic and sufficiently grimdark, and not an accidental addition to the stereotype of Custom Chapters being poorly thought out snowflakes.
